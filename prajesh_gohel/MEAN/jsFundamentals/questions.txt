1. What are classes and object constructors used for?
    Classes are used as a blueprint to write instances of that class. This allow us to speed up our code since we are using reusable code that can be accessed later. In ES5, a class keyword does not exist, so instead we write functions that act as Object Constructors.

2. What is 'this' referring to in a class?
    'This' refers to a specific instance when the Object Constructor is run. 'This' will always refer to its immediate parent when run.

3. Write a class (ES5 or ES6) for a Car:
  a. 2 attributes for damage done to a car and max speed.
  b. Add a method so one car can bump into another, which will increase the damage done to each car.
  c. Create 2 car objects and have them bump into one another.
